# jermd 0.0.1

* Add `masterthesis` (still in development), the template for my master's thesis at University of Bremen.
* Add `uebungsblatt` template for assignments. It's okayish because I've used it for 3 semesters.
* Add `bericht` template. Don't use this, it's buggy and only here to document my shame.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
