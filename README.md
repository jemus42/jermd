# jermd

**Je**msu **Rmd** templates â€“ A minimal(ish) R package for RMarkdown templates.

They used to be included in my general-miscellaneous `{jemisc}` package, but I extracted them here to have them isolated in one package with minimal dependencies (namely `{rmarkdown}` and `{bookdown}`).

## Included templates

See `system.file("examples", package = "jermd")` for rendered examples.

- `bericht`: Hastily written for a report. Not very well, I might add. Don't use it, only for reference in case some detail of it works well.
- `uebungsblatt`: Written for weekly assignments and tweaked over the course of 3 semesters. Should be kind of okay to use.
