<!--
Edit these lines as appropriate.
The actual thesis content is in several Rmd files.

You'll need to edit the _bookdown.yml file to set the order in which you'd like them to appear.
-->

**Notice**: This file has to be named `index.Rmd`. If you created it from the RStudio template picker thingy and gave it a filename,
you'll have to rename it.

Maybe I'll figure out how to fix this, sorry.
