# Bericht

It should be noted that this template is pretty broken on many levels and was created as a bunch of weird LaTeX hacks to make at least *some* kind of submittable report under time constraints. 

Don't use it.  
Unless it's for inspiration on how to do it (significantly) better.


It is only included in this package as documentation for myself.
